By following this custom exercise program, you would be able to strength your upper body muscles and do multiple push ups in a very short period of time üôåüèΩ                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Once you select the week and the day for your pushups program, you would need to enter a number in the require field which represent the amount of pushups that you can do at this moment; once this number has been entered, the app would create a custom 6 weeks pushups program just for you. Example: 5 sets with different amount of pushups to do per each set. Once you have completed one set of pushups, we would suggest you to rest the designated rest period of time (10 seconds, however you can take your time to rest as much as you please) before procceding to do the next set of pushups. After you have completed the 5 set of pushups repetitions, you should rest the next day since every 5 sets workout is equal to an upper body workout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             We recommend to perform this exercise on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, so you can rest one day in between this workout. This program would last for a total of 6 weeks period and at the end of it, you would notice a huge increase in your upper body strength ‚úÖ                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Before proceeding with any physical activity, including the push-up workout, please be aware that you are voluntarily participating at your own risk.
